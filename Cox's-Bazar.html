    <h1> About Our Cox's Bazar</h1>
    <p>Cox's Bazar (/ˌkɒksɪz bəˈzɑː/; Bengali: কক্সবাজার, romanized: Kôksbajar; pronounced [kɔksbadʒaɾ]) is a city, fishing port, tourism centre, and district headquarters in Southeastern Bangladesh. The iconic Cox's Bazar Beach, one of the most popular tourist attractions in Bangladesh, is the longest uninterrupted beach in the world.[2] It is located 150 km (93 mi) south of the city of Chittagong. Cox's Bazar is also known by the name Panowa, which translates literally as "yellow flower." Another old name was "Palongkee". Kutupalong refugee camp with more than a million Rohingya refugees is in Cox's Bazar.[3] </p>
