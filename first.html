<h1>Welcome to our gochary shop</h1>
<p>A <em>supermarket</em> is a self-service shop offering a wide <b>variety</b> of food, beverages and household products, organized into sections. This kind of store is larger and has a <i>wider</i> selection than earlier grocery stores, but is smaller and more limited in the range of merchandise than a hypermarket or big-box market. In <strong>everyday</strong> U.S. usage, however, "grocery store" is often used to mean "supermarket"</p>
